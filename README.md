Columns included:

Performed basic cleaning tasks to make the data accurate and consistent:

Used Spell Check (F7) to correct typing errors.

Applied TRIM() formula to remove extra spaces.

Checked for missing values in important columns.

Used Remove Duplicates option to clean repeated rows.

Standardized text values (e.g., Approved / Pending / Rejected).

### 3️⃣ Data Formatting

Formatted the data to make it more readable and professional:

Bold and center-aligned headers.

Applied consistent date format (dd-mm-yyyy).

Used number format for Total Leave Days.

Applied borders and alternate row colors for better visibility.

Froze header row for easier navigation.

### 4️⃣ New Columns Created

Added extra columns to make the dataset analysis-ready:

Total Leave Days → =DATEDIF(Leave Start Date, Leave End Date, "D")+1

Month → =TEXT(Leave Start Date, "mmmm")

Year → =YEAR(Leave Start Date)

### 5️⃣ Conditional Formatting

Used color-based formatting to make important patterns stand out:

Status column:

Approved → Green

Pending → Yellow

Rejected → Red

Total Leave Days greater than 3 → Highlighted in Light Blue

Sorted and filtered data by Department, Status, and Leave Type for quick insights.
